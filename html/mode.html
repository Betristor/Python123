        <h1>Perfect time to learn python</h1>
        <p>It's a good time to learn <em><a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a></em>!</p>
        <p>It not only means now is the best time to do some learning about python,but also means
            in this age python is a good programming language to use in daily job and 
            work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe now python can't replace C or C++ as the best language,but depending on its
            easy usage and massive useful libs,it will help coder fastlily and effectively
            code.

        <h2>How to learn Python</h2>
        <p>When asked how to learn Python,usually I fell into a thinking status 
           and then pretended to be shameful that I don't know how to learn python.
           It's true,but I have some tips for you,rather than useful suggestion.
           <em>First</em> you need to learn basic programming grammer,which is ,emmm,
           how to say,the base of your later learning.<em>Second</em> you have to 
           know data structure so that you can easily construct a program.
