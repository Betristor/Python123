        <h1>Perfect time to learn python</h1>
        <p>It's a good time to learn <em><a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a></em>!</p>
        <p>It not only means now is the best time to do some learning about python,but also means
            in this age python is a good programming language to use in daily job and 
            work.

        <p>
            Maybe now python can't replace C or C++ as the best language,but depending on its
            easy usage and massive useful libs,it will help coder fastlily and effectively
            code.
