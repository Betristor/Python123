                Now I'm learning some useful tags in HTML5 about texts.It may be a little 
                hard for a non-native-speaker,but some new trails will push me into a 
                brand new <strong>world</strong>.

                Actually I don't think that a man should be taken care
                well in this miserable world.Those who want to hurt you,no 
                matter with purpose or without,will do anything they can to 
                make evil.
